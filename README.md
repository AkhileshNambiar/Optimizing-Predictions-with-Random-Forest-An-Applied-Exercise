# Optimizing-Predictions-with-Random-Forest-An-Applied-Exercise
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of the Random Forest algorithm for predictive modeling. It involves data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The notebook provides a hands-on guide to leveraging Random Forest's ensemble learning capabilities to improve prediction accuracy while interpreting feature importance.
